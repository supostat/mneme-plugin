# mneme

**Your agent forgets. The canon doesn't.**

Persistent cross-project memory and a phase-workflow engine for Claude Code —
human-gated, local-first, event-sourced. Installed as a plugin.

## What is mneme

Two halves, one MCP server:

- **Memory** — `remember` / `recall` over a file-based note corpus. Nothing is
  ever auto-published: every note passes a **human staging gate** before it can
  surface in recall. Notes anchor to real files in your repos, and recall
  ranks by those anchors — memory that answers where you actually work.
- **Workflow engine** — phases with dependencies, machine-run `done-when`
  gates, bounded retries and an append-only event log. The engine issues
  directives; the agent executes them; the harvest of every phase flows back
  into memory — through the same human gate.

## Key features

- **Human-gated by construction** — the staging queue is a review step, not a
  formality; the agent can propose memory, only you can accept it.
- **Local-first** — the corpus lives in `~/.mneme/`, embeddings come from your
  local Ollama; nothing leaves the machine.
- **Event-sourced** — runs are rebuilt from an append-only JSONL log; a new
  session resumes exactly where the last one stopped.
- **Machine-verified phases** — `done-when` gates are real commands run by the
  engine, not checkbox prose.
- **Five bundled skills** — `/mneme:plan`, `/mneme:dev`, `/mneme:arch`,
  `/mneme:migrate`, `/mneme:resume`: idea → spec → phases → gated execution.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Claude Code (CLI, desktop or IDE extension) and
**[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** running locally — mneme computes recall
embeddings through it. macOS or Linux on arm64/x64, `curl` available.

From any Claude Code session:

```
claude plugin marketplace add supostat/mneme-plugin
claude plugin install mneme@mneme-marketplace
```

Verify with `/mcp`: the `mneme` server should list its tools (`remember`,
`recall`, `staging_list`, `staging_resolve`, `stats`, `workflow_start`,
`workflow_step`).

Update later with `/plugin update` — every engine release bumps the plugin
version automatically, so updates are always visible.

## How the server starts

The plugin ships no binary. A small POSIX-sh launcher downloads the pinned
engine build for your platform from this repo's GitHub Releases into
`~/.mneme/bin/`, verifies its SHA256 against the committed release pin
**before** making it executable, and reuses the cache afterwards; a
SessionStart hook pre-warms the cache so the first real start does not wait.
Bundle internals: [plugin/README.md](plugin/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

The launcher never fails silently: every failure is a named line on stderr,
and `/mcp` shows the server as failed with that message.

| Error line | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no local build and no release pin` | Installed from GitHub before the engine published its first release — there is nothing to download yet. | Wait for the first engine release, then `/plugin update`. |
| `download failed (no network or missing release asset)` | No connectivity, or the pinned release asset is unavailable. | Check the network and retry; the cache fills on the next start. |
| `checksum mismatch` | The downloaded binary does not match the pinned SHA256. The file is deleted and **nothing is installed or executed**. | Retry; if it persists, the release is corrupt — open an issue. |
| `unsupported platform` / `unsupported architecture` | Not macOS/Linux on arm64/x64. | These four targets are the supported set. |

If the server is up but `recall` returns nothing, check that Ollama is running.
